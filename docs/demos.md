# Demos

Quick demos to validate the stack.

- demo_simple.py — loads models, learns small dataset, runs queries
- demo_wikipedia_learning.py — larger learning walkthrough
- demo_end_to_end.py — end-to-end scenario (if present)

Tips:
- Ensure Rust extension is built (maturin develop --release)
- Prefer smaller embedding models for quick iteration
