# Sutra Models Documentation

Welcome to the Sutra Models documentation. This repo uses native HNSW vector search in Rust (ConcurrentStorage) and a simplified Python layer.

Structure:
- architecture/
  - overview.md — high-level system architecture
  - enterprise.md — deployment, scaling, reliability, security
- packages/ — package-specific guides (sutra-core, sutra-storage, sutra-hybrid)
- development/ — setup, testing, and workflows
- migrations/ — upgrade guides between versions
- demos.md — demos and examples

Getting started:
- Read architecture/overview.md and architecture/enterprise.md
- Then see development/setup.md and development/testing.md
