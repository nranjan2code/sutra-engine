# Sutra AI - System Architecture

**An explainable AI system that learns in real-time without retraining**

Version: 2.0.0 | Status: Production-ready | Last Updated: 2025-10-19

## 🚨 CRITICAL PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS

### Embedding System (MANDATORY)

**⚠️ WARNING:** The system CANNOT function without proper embedding configuration. All production deployments MUST ensure:

1. **Ollama Service**: Must be accessible at `SUTRA_OLLAMA_URL` with `granite-embedding:30m` model loaded
2. **TCP Protocol**: ALL services MUST use `sutra-storage-client-tcp` package - NEVER direct storage access
3. **Message Format**: Unit variants (`GetStats`, `Flush`, `HealthCheck`) send string, not `{variant: {}}`
4. **Vector Serialization**: Always convert numpy arrays to Python lists before TCP transport
5. **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic for TCP connection failures

**Common Failure Modes:**
- "No embedding processor available" → Ollama not accessible or model not loaded
- "can not serialize 'numpy.ndarray' object" → Missing array-to-list conversion
- "wrong msgpack marker" → Incorrect message format for unit variants
- "Connection closed" → TCP client using wrong protocol

---

## Executive Summary

Sutra AI is a **graph-based reasoning system** with complete explainability. Unlike black-box LLMs, every decision includes the full reasoning path showing how the system arrived at its answer.

**Core Innovation:** Temporal knowledge graphs + semantic embeddings + multi-path reasoning = Explainable AI that learns continuously without retraining.

**Performance:** 57,412 writes/sec, <0.01ms reads, 100% accuracy verified (25,000× faster than previous JSON-based storage).

## System Architecture

### High-Level (gRPC-first)

```
┌───────────────┐         gRPC          ┌─────────────────────┐
│  sutra-api    │ ───────────────────▶  │  storage-server     │
│  (FastAPI)    │ ◀───────────────────  │  (Rust, gRPC)       │
└───────────────┘                       └─────────────────────┘
        ▲                                        ▲
        │                                        │
        └──────────── gRPC ──────────────────────┘

┌───────────────┐
│ sutra-hybrid  │  (embeddings + orchestration)
└───────────────┘
```

Design principle: All graph and vector operations run in the storage server. API and Hybrid never access storage in-process; they use the Python storage-client over gRPC.

**Design Principle:** Only `sutra-api` is external-facing. Core, hybrid, and storage are internal implementation details.

## Package Structure

### 1. **sutra-storage** (Rust) — Production-Ready Storage Engine

**Purpose:** High-performance, burst-tolerant storage for temporal knowledge graphs.

**Key Features:**
- **57,412 writes/sec** (25,000× faster than JSON baseline)
- **<0.01ms read latency** (zero-copy memory-mapped files)
- Lock-free write log with background reconciliation
- Single-file architecture (`storage.dat`, 512MB initial size)
- Immutable read snapshots (readers never block writers)
- BFS path finding and graph traversal
- 100% test pass rate with verified accuracy

**Innovation:** Dual-plane architecture — writers append to lock-free log, readers access immutable snapshots. Reconciler runs asynchronously every 10ms.

**Documentation:**
- [`packages/sutra-storage/ARCHITECTURE.md`](packages/sutra-storage/ARCHITECTURE.md) — Detailed design
- [`docs/sutra-storage/README.md`](docs/sutra-storage/README.md) — Production guide, benchmarks, API reference

---

### 2. **sutra-core** (Python) — Graph Reasoning Engine

**Purpose:** Core AI reasoning using graph traversal and multi-path consensus.

**Key Components:**
- **ReasoningEngine**: Orchestrates learning, querying, and caching
- **PathFinder**: Multi-strategy graph traversal (best-first, BFS, bidirectional)
- **MultiPathAggregator (MPPA)**: Consensus-based reasoning to prevent single-path errors
- **AssociationExtractor**: Extracts typed relationships (semantic, causal, temporal, hierarchical)

**Reasoning Strategies:**
- Confidence decay (0.85 per hop) for realistic path scoring
- Cycle detection and path diversification
- Path clustering and majority voting
- Robustness analysis with diversity bonus

**Documentation:**
- [`docs/packages/sutra-core.md`](docs/packages/sutra-core.md) — Component guide

---

### 3. **sutra-hybrid** (Python) — Semantic Embeddings Layer

**Purpose:** Combines graph reasoning with optional semantic similarity matching.

**Key Features:**
- Optional semantic embeddings (graph reasoning works standalone)
- Multi-strategy comparison (graph-only vs semantic-enhanced)
- Agreement scoring between strategies
- Full audit trails for compliance

**SutraAI Class:**
- High-level interface for learning and querying
- Knowledge persistence via `save()` and `load()`
- Configurable strategy selection

**Documentation:**
- [`docs/packages/sutra-hybrid.md`](docs/packages/sutra-hybrid.md) — Integration guide

---

### 4. **sutra-api** (FastAPI) — Production REST API

**Purpose:** External HTTP interface with rate limiting and monitoring.

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /learn` — Add knowledge
- `POST /reason` — Query with reasoning paths
- `POST /save` — Persist to disk
- `GET /health` — System status
- `GET /stats` — Performance metrics

**Features:**
- Rate limiting (configurable per endpoint)
- Request validation
- OpenAPI documentation at `/docs`
- CORS support

**Documentation:**
- [`docs/packages/sutra-api.md`](docs/packages/sutra-api.md) — API reference

## Core Design Principles

### 1. **Explainability First**
Every decision includes complete reasoning paths. No "magic" — you can trace every step from question to answer.

### 2. **Separation of Concerns**
```
Write Plane:  Lock-free log (throughput optimized)
Read Plane:   Immutable snapshots (latency optimized)
Reconciler:   Async coordination (invisible to users)
```

### 3. **Zero-Copy Philosophy**
Memory-mapped files + direct pointer access = no serialization overhead for internal operations.

### 4. **Temporal Awareness**
Knowledge evolves over time. Storage is log-structured with timestamps for time-travel queries.

### 5. **Graph-Native**
Data structures optimized for graph traversal, not tables or documents. Adjacency lists, BFS, and confidence propagation are first-class operations.

## Key Algorithms

### 1. **Multi-Path Plan Aggregation (MPPA)**
Consensus-based reasoning to prevent single-path derailment:
- Find multiple independent paths
- Cluster paths by answer similarity (0.8 threshold)
- Majority voting with diversity bonus
- Return answer + confidence + robustness metrics

### 2. **Confidence Decay**
Realistic confidence propagation through reasoning chains:
```
final_confidence = initial_confidence × (0.85 ^ path_length)
```

### 3. **Path Diversification**
- Cycle detection (visited node tracking)
- Path similarity threshold (0.7 max overlap)
- Alternative route exploration

### 4. **Concurrent Reconciliation**
- Writers: Append to lock-free queue (crossbeam channel)
- Readers: Access immutable snapshot (arc-swap)
- Reconciler: Batch process queue → update snapshot (10ms loop)

## What Works (Production Verified)

✅ **Learn new knowledge** — Add concepts and relationships  
✅ **Query with reasoning paths** — Get answers with explanations  
✅ **Save to disk** — Persist knowledge (single `storage.dat` file)  
✅ **Reload from disk** — Restore complete state after restart  
✅ **Multi-strategy reasoning** — Compare graph-only vs semantic-enhanced  
✅ **Audit trails** — Full compliance tracking  
✅ **REST API** — Production-ready HTTP interface  
✅ **Performance** — 57K writes/sec, <0.01ms reads, 100% accuracy  

---

## Current Limitations

1. **Limited reasoning depth** — Works well for 2-3 hops, gets expensive beyond 6 hops
2. **No natural language generation** — Returns concept content, not fluent text
3. **Requires structured input** — Works best with clear factual statements
4. **No common sense reasoning** — Only knows what you teach it
5. **English-only** — NLP components are English-centric
6. **Recovery on restart** — Data persists but auto-load not yet implemented (workaround: load manually)

## Design Trade-offs

### Why Graph-Based?
**Pro:** Inherently explainable — trace every path  
**Con:** Doesn't capture statistical patterns like LLMs

### Why Rust for Storage?
**Pro:** Zero-copy, lock-free, predictable performance  
**Con:** Steeper learning curve than Python-only

### Why Optional Embeddings?
**Pro:** Pure graph = 100% explainable; embeddings = enhanced recall  
**Con:** Some opacity when embeddings are used (but contribution is tracked)

### Why Single-File Storage?
**Pro:** Simple deployment, easy backup, OS-managed paging  
**Con:** File grows large (but memory-mapped, so only active data in RAM)

### Why REST API as Sole Interface?
**Pro:** Clean separation, versioning, polyglot clients  
**Con:** No low-latency in-process API (but Python bindings available internally)
