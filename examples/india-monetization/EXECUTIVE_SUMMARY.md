## Why India? Why Now?

### Market Realities
- **70M+ Udyam registered businesses** (government data is public)
- **₹2 lakh Cr PLI scheme** (Production Linked Incentive - requires MSME sourcing)
- **₹945 Cr Startup India Seed Fund** (needs explainable due diligence)
- **₹4+ lakh Cr GeM marketplace** (government procurement needs supplier intelligence)
- **400K+ CAs, 70K+ CSs** (they advise 95% of Indian businesses)

### Indian B2B SaaS Economics
- **4-6x ARR valuations** for profitable companies (vs 10-15x in US)
- **Profitability expected by Year 3** (not Year 7)
- **Capital efficiency mandatory** (raise ₹100 Cr total, not ₹1,000 Cr)
- **Government contracts = 40% revenue** (stable, high-margin)

## Fast Revenue Strategy

### Fastest: CA/CS Firms (4-6 weeks to revenue)
**Why:**
- Smallest sales cycle in India
- Already pay ₹20,000-50,000/month for tools (Taxmann, CCH)
- Network effect (CAs refer other CAs)
- Explainability = their core value proposition

**Approach:**
- Pilot with 5 firms (free for 2 months)
- Pricing: ₹25,000-1,50,000/month based on firm size
- Target: 50 firms by Year 1 end = ₹2 Cr ARR

### Quick: TReDS Integration (6-8 weeks)
**Why:**
- Regulatory mandate (government requires MSME invoice discounting)
- Only 3 platforms (concentrated market)
- API-based (fast integration)

**Approach:**
- Credit risk scoring: ₹50-200 per assessment
- Volume: 10,000-50,000 queries/month per platform
- Target: ₹60 lakhs ARR by Year 1 end

## Competitive Advantages (India-Specific)

### 1. Government Data Moat
- Udyam registration data is public but unstructured
- Our AI normalization creates barrier
- Real-time updates vs competitors' stale data

### 2. Explainability = Compliance
- Government contracts require audit trails
- Banks need RBI compliance
- TReDS platforms need due diligence documentation
- **We're the only platform with complete reasoning paths**

### 3. Temporal + Causal Understanding
- Track policy evolution ("What changed after Budget 2024?")
- Root cause analysis ("Why do MSMEs in textiles default more?")
- No competitor has this capability

### 4. Self-Monitoring Proof Point
- We monitor our own Grid using Sutra (no Grafana/Prometheus)
- Proves it works at scale
- Case study for DevOps sales

## Risks & Mitigation

**Mitigation:** Alternative data sources (GST, MCA, bank partnerships)

### Risk 2: Price Sensitivity
**Mitigation:** Annual contracts with discounts, multi-product bundling

### Risk 3: Payment Collection
**Mitigation:** Prepaid credits, auto-debit mandates, no credit for SMEs

### Risk 4: Competition from Giants
